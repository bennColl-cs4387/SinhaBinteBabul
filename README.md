# Open Source Programming in Practice

## Bio:
Welcome to Sinha’s repository for the Open Source Programming class! I’m a senior majoring in Computer Science and Statistics, with a minor in Animation. This repository showcases my work for the course. I took this class to improve my coding skills, enhance my ability to read and understand code written by others, and gain more experience with GitHub and the command-line interface (CLI).

Here are my [GitHub](https://github.com/sinhabintebabul) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sinhabintebabul/) profiles linked.

  Seeking another quick Scikit-Learn issue to resolve before the end of the term.


## Group Fix:
For the [Group Fix](https://github.com/bennColl-cs4387/sizar/tree/683aaff7e677dbc9f95600f803d964a25c0ea889/assignments/group-fix/pycaret-3011), I collaborated with Sizar and Arpon to address a bug in the PyCaret library. The issue, [#3011](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/issues/3011), involved a problem with one of the features of PyCaret’s time forecasting model. During the cross-validation step, the model was supposed to display the number of folds into which the training data was divided. However, instead of showing the correct number, it displayed the object itself. The solution required modifying the code to correctly display the length of the object.

The most important learning experience for me during this group fix was reproducing a bug accurately, as it was my first attempt at fixing one. I also learned how to navigate the source code effectively to pinpoint the exact location of the bug and determine which lines required changes. Additionally, observing and collaborating with my teammates was incredibly insightful. They began with a thorough background study, including theoretical research, which I joined as well. This structured approach significantly improved my understanding of the issue and how to tackle it systematically.

## Learnings:

#### Reflection on the Course
This course has been a good learning experience. One of the key things I learned was how to use GitHub and navigate through its features. I now feel more comfortable with version control tasks like cloning repositories, creating branches, and making pull requests. I also learned how to work with Git locally, including committing changes, pushing them to GitHub, and pulling updates. 
Setting up and managing virtual environments was another important part of the course. I learned why they’re useful, especially for keeping projects organized and avoiding dependency conflicts. A big part of this course involved understanding source codes and exploring large codebases like PyCaret and Scikit-learn. 

#### Major Challenges
One of the hardest things for me was building a scikit learn library from source. I ran into errors almost every time I tried to do it. Most of the problems came from the .meson package, which didn’t compile properly. It took a lot of trial and error to get it to work, and this was frustrating at times. However, it taught me to stay patient and keep trying until I figured it out.

#### What I Wish I Learned More
While I enjoyed working on PyCaret and Scikit-learn, both of these libraries are focused on data science and machine learning. I wish I had had the chance to explore a codebase in a completely different area, like web development or utilities. This would have helped me gain a broader perspective.
