## Essay on First Solo Fix

For my first solo open-source fix, I selected the [Scikit-Learn codebase](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) and identified a specific issue [Issue #24313](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/24313) that aligns with my interest in data science and machine learning. Scikit-Learn is an actively maintained open-source library, primarily coded in Python, with libraries implemented in Cython.

Scikit-Learn was started in 2007 by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer of Code project. The core contributors are individuals like researchers, software engineers, and data scientists. Many contributors come from corporations like IBM, Microsoft, and Google, which use Scikit-Learn extensively in data science and machine learning applications. Two of the top contributors are Olivier Grisel, a machine learning engineer, and Andreas Mueller, a research software development engineer at Microsoft.

#### Why Scikit-Learn is a Good Fit

As mentioned earlier, I chose Scikit-Learn because of my interest in data science and machine learning. Moreover, I have used Scikit-Learn in different instances, which makes me somewhat familiar with the library. Its dependencies include other libraries like Matplotlib, Pandas, and SciPy, which I am also familiar with. While reviewing issues, I noticed that many involve bug fixes related to model performance and parameters, which felt conceptually familiar. Additionally, the codebase is very well-structured and maintained, making it easy to locate directories containing source code for specific issues. This allowed me to review multiple source codes even before reproducing the issue, which increased my comfort level with selecting this library as my first solo fix.

#### Issue Details

Issue #24313 addresses a bug in the BayesianRidge regression model, where the standard deviation of predictions is incorrectly affected by uniform sample weights during fitting. Specifically, when uniform sample weights are applied, the scale of the standard deviations in predictions changes proportionally to the scale of the weights, which should not be the case. The standard deviation of predictions should remain unaffected by uniform sample weights. This issue was reported on September 1, 2022, but it has not garnered much attention from the community.

#### Potential Ways to Solve the Issue

First, I plan to investigate the weight normalization process by examining the current implementation of the BayesianRidge model to understand how sample weights are applied during fitting. I will also identify sections where the weights influence the computation of the covariance matrix and the standard deviation of predictions.

To effectively solve this issue, I may need to conduct some background study on how the model functions, potentially exploring Bayesian inference, sample weighting, and variance calculations in regression models.
