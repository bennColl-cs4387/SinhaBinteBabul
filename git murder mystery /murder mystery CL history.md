A murder had been committed in Git Town!

The detective, Kyle Pumbinner, said the crime scene report is on the `gtpd-archive` branch. He
doesn't really remember the report ID... But he knows it was the first report he submitted after his
son's ninth birthday (which was Saturday, July 20th), and it was the only report he submitted that
week.

When you find a suspect, you'd probably want to interview them. To do that, first find out their
address. To go to that street, look for the street's name in the repository (Hint: it's a tag). To
go to house number N on that street, go to the Nth ancestor. If you'd like to inspect the
perimeters, you can look into the commit's contents - it'll contain a hash that you can view with
certain git commands.

Think you found the culprit? Check your answer with the following command:

echo "John Doe" | git hash-object --stdin | grep -iq -f /dev/stdin <(git show solution) && echo 'You found the murderer!' || echo 'No cigar, chief... Try again.'

Replace John Doe with the name of the suspect that you want to check.

For an extra challenge, try and solve the mystery without ever using `git checkout`.

    "My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas
    present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I
    would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of
    the birds--a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open, I
    thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt
    the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and
    out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose
    and fluttered off among the others.

    "'Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?' says she.

    "Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of the business?"

    "Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand
    stock, paying 4Â½ per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the
    interest."

    "As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side. Now, would
    you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?"

    Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in
    every way to force the shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through which a knife
    could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid
    iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. "Hum!" said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity,
    "my theory certainly presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were
    bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter."

    A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened. Holmes
    refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner
    was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room, with a
    low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of
    drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the
    left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the
    furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and the

    "I do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing. "The matter was perfectly simple. You, of
    course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening."

    "I guessed as much."

    "Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed
    forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick."

    "That also I could fathom."

    subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China.
    When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more
    simple."

    Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said he. "I thought at first that you had done
    something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it, after all."

    "I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes, "that I make a mistake in explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro

    "Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off, and there they have lived
    rent free on my best land ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn
    where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for
    he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must
    have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a
    thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.

    "His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known to be in weak health, it
    seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was firm.
    I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his
    blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his
    worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.

    "When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a
    tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me
    seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what
    she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all
    that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was
    already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my
    own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul
    tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of
    martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was
    more than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul
    and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I
    was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true story,
    gentlemen, of all that occurred."

    "Well, it is not for me to judge you," said Holmes as the old man signed the statement which had
    been drawn out. "I pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation."

    "I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?"

    "In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your
    deed at a higher court than the Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I
    shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether
    you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us."

    "Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese," said he.

    "My geese!" The man seemed surprised.

    "Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a member of your goose club."

    "Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them's not our geese."

    "Indeed! Whose, then?"

    "The glass still keeps very high," he remarked as he sat down. "It is of importance that it should
    not rain before we are able to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very
    best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long
    journey. I have seen young McCarthy."

    "And what did you learn from him?"

    "Nothing."

    "Could he throw no light?"

    "None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him
    or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted
    youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart."

    "I cannot admire his taste," I remarked, "if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage
    with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner."

    We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.

    "I thought it as well," said Holmes as we climbed the stile, "that this fellow should think we had
    come here as architects, or on some definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss
    Stoner. You see that we have been as good as our word."

    Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy. "I have
    been waiting so eagerly for you," she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. "All has turned out
    splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening."

    "We have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance," said Holmes, and in a few words he
    sketched out what had occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.

    "Good heavens!" she cried, "he has followed me, then."

    "So it appears."

    "'I quite follow you,' said I. 'The only point which I could not quite understand was what use you
    could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller's-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out
    like gravel from a pit.'

    "'Ah!' said he carelessly, 'we have our own process. We compress the earth into bricks, so as to
    remove them without revealing what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into
    my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.' He rose as he spoke. 'I
    shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11.15.'

    "'I shall certainly be there.'

    "'And not a word to a soul.' He looked at me with a last long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing
    my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room.

    "Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished, as you may both
    think, at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was
    glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own
    services, and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones. On the other hand, the face
    and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his
    explanation of the fuller's-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight,
    and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the
    winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the
    injunction as to holding my tongue.

    "At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station. However, I was in time for the last
    train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock. I was the only
    passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with
    a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of the morning
    waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a
    carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the
    wood-work, and away we went as fast as the horse could go."

    Murder took place ten days ago, on July 14th. Coroner report says it was some time between 16:13 and
    19:37.

    According to the security guard that sat at the entrance to the factory, on the day of the murder no
    one came through the front door. So that leaves the back door, which requires an RFID card to open.

    With the help of the factory's IT department I managed to cherry-pick the relevant commits from the
    access log for all the electronically locked facilities on premise. They're on my personal
    'detectives/kpumbinner' branch. But they said the program doesn't have a search button... I'll have
    to sift through it to find who used "BACKDOOR_332". I put the log file in the evidence folder to
    look through later.

    "Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There was never any mystery in the
    matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that
    there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel."

    "Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?"

    The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we
    heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.

    "This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "He has written to me to say that
    he would be here at six. Come in!"

    "'I had Â£4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.'

    "'Oh, tut, tut! sweating--rank sweating!' he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a
    man who is in a boiling passion. 'How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such
    attractions and accomplishments?'

    "'My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,' said I. 'A little French, a little German,
    music, and drawing--'

    "'Tut, tut!' he cried. 'This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have you or have you
    not the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not
    fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the
    country. But if you have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything
    under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at Â£100 a year.'

    "You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good
    to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a
    pocket-book and took out a note.

    "'It is also my custom,' said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two
    little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, 'to advance to my young ladies half their
    salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.'

    "He looked inside the envelope. 'So it is,' he cried. 'Here are the very letters. But what is this
    written above them?'

    "'Put the papers on the sundial,' I read, peeping over his shoulder.

    "'What papers? What sundial?' he asked.

    "'The sundial in the garden. There is no other,' said I; 'but the papers must be those that are
    destroyed.'

    "'Pooh!' said he, gripping hard at his courage. 'We are in a civilised land here, and we can't have
    tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the thing come from?'

    "'From Dundee,' I answered, glancing at the postmark.

    "At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station. However, I was in time for the last
    train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock. I was the only
    passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with
    a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of the morning
    waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a
    carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the
    wood-work, and away we went as fast as the horse could go."

    "One horse?" interjected Holmes.

    "Yes, only one."

    "Did you observe the colour?"

    "Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage. It was a chestnut."

    know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind
    of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which
    she would not go--none."

    "You are sure that she has not sent it yet?"

    "I am sure."

    "And why?"

    "Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed.
    That will be next Monday."

    "From Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he
    passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was
    William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr.
    McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr.
    McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm.
    To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following
    him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had
    occurred.

    "The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of
    them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the
    edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe
    Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she saw,
    at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to
    be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son,
    and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their
    violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two
    McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She
    had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had
    found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited,
    without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with
    fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool.
    The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such
    as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's gun, which was found lying on
    the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly
    arrested, and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on
    Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next Assizes.
    Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court."

    "I could hardly imagine a more damning case," I remarked. "If ever circumstantial evidence pointed
    to a criminal it does so here."

    "Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing," answered Holmes thoughtfully. "It may seem to
    point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it
    pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be confessed,
    however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible that
    he is indeed the culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them
    Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have
    retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the
    case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is
    that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly
    digesting their breakfasts at home."

    "I am afraid," said I, "that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained
    out of this case."

    "There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact," he answered, laughing. "Besides, we may
    chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade.
    You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy
    his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding. To take the
    first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-
    hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as
    that."

    "That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it's a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his
    brains to crime it is the worst of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with
    your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn."

    I had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the
    scene of this investigation. We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner
    nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.

    "It is very essential, Miss Stoner," said he, "that you should absolutely follow my advice in every
    respect."

    "I shall most certainly do so."

    "The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend upon your compliance."

    "I assure you that I am in your hands."

    "That is enough." She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face. "I shall
    go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my
    poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow." With a few grateful words to Holmes she
    bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.

    "At least," said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, "she seems to be a young
    lady who is very well able to take care of herself."

    "And she would need to be," said Holmes gravely. "I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her
    before many days are past."

    Yeah, of course I used the backdoor to the factory, that's the closest entrance to the freezer and I
    brought in some ingrediants that can't really stand the heat.

    At the time of the murder I was at a block party right down the street from here, we threw the party
    for one of the neighbors who got back from the hospital after an accident. I was with my kids. You
    can ask anyone who's been there.

    Oh wait, you know what? We took a picture... Let me get my phone.

    See? That's me, that's the neighbor, here's my little girl. And you see the timestamp?

    So yeah, I really don't have anything to do with that... Barely knew the victim...

    But you know what? I did see someone rushing out of the factory... He got into a green Hyundai, you
    don't see many of those around here... Probably a rental. I didn't catch his face, was just weird
    seeing someone running off like that... Come to think about it, maybe that person had something to
    do with it?

    Anyways, best of luck catching whoever did it!

    I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no
    harm."

    The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the
    fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of
    us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were
    vainly striving to keep the flames under.

    "That's it!" cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. "There is the gravel-drive, and there are the
    rose-bushes where I lay. That second window is the one that I jumped from."

Nobody's home. From the stack of letters in the mailbox nobody's been here for a good few days.

Without a warrant you can't get into the house, but you can still checkout the area. Maybe talk with
some of the neighbors.

The guy next door says he barely ever spoke to the suspect, "was a bit of a loner" is what he says.
Doesn't know what type of vehicle he drives.

You take a stroll around the house, there's a back porch that probably seen better days. You spot a
driveway next to it leading to a garage. The door's open and you see a green Hyundai parked there.

    "Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely examined."

    "Now, my dear sir," said Holmes. "is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very
    much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be
    a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory. You
    suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened
    your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some
    other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them,
    and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the
    greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?"

    "But what other is there?" cried the banker with a gesture of despair. "If his motives were
    innocent, why does he not explain them?"

    "It is our task to find that out," replied Holmes; "so now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we will set
    off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details."

There's no one answering the door. Obviously you won't break in because you don't have a warrant or
anything. But nothing's wrong with looking around the place...

You check around the house, there's no car. Not even a driveway. You do find a bike resting against
the fence. It's pretty close to the factory, so makes sense the suspect bikes to work.

Just to make sure, you ask some of the neighbors, they confirm that the suspect doesn't own a car.
One of them says he doesn't even have a license.

Another neighbor says he saw the suspect coming back from work on the day of the murder at about
5PM, they chatted for a bit before his sister picked him up to visit their parents. They live pretty
far away, so that places him away from Git Town at the time of the murder.
