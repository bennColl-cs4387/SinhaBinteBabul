## Solo Fix Progress Report 1

#### Codebase: [Scikit-Learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)
#### Issue: [#24313](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/24313)
#### Issue Topic: Standard Deviation of Bayesian Ridge Regression Model’s Predictions Affected by Uniform Sample Weights
#### Expected Behavior: Applying uniform sample weights should not affect the prediction’s standard deviation.
#### Actual Behavior: The standard deviation increases proportionally to the uniform weight applied to samples.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### First Task:
* Issue Analysis: Spent time thoroughly understanding the issue, reviewing the codebase to grasp the BayesianRidge model’s implementation.
* Background Research: Conducted research on Bayesian inference and the expected behavior of sample weights on variance within Bayesian models.
* Contribution Review: Revisited Scikit-Learn’s contribution guidelines to ensure I understand the process for making a pull request and performing tests on new adjustments.


#### Challenges Faced:
* Issue Replication: Encountered difficulties in properly replicating the issue; importing the BayesianRidge model from the linear model directory failed. Tried various approaches but ultimately had to rebuild the project from source. This took time,even though I built it before. This time I ensured the rebuild was free from dependency conflicts.
* Test Validation: I’m not yet fully confident in passing the required tests and validating my solution accurately. I aim to develop a clearer approach to testing over the next few days.

#### Progress Expectations:
By next week, I plan to replicate the issue successfully and dive deeper into the codebase to develop a structured solution for the bug.
